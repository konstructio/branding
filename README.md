kubefirst provides fully automated open source application delivery and infrastructure management GitOps platforms delivering the best cloud native tools working together in minutes.

Supporting Amazon Web Service (AWS), Google Cloud, Civo, DigitalOcean, and Vultr clouds, you have the choice to use GitHub or GitLab as your Git provider. Using the CLI or the simple UI, you will end up with a full-fledged production ready Kubernetes cluster with tools like Argo CD, HashiCorp Vault, Terraform, and Atlantis.

All applications are managed by Argo CD using a single GitOps Git repository that you get to host and extend in any direction. The Terraform and Atlantis setup produces an audit log of all system changes in the single GitOps Git repository that also manages all your Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and resources. kubefirst provides a user platform and Single Sign-On (SSO) OIDC provider powered by HashiCorp Vault which is integrated throughout all of the platform tools, and used as the exclusive source of truth for all secrets.

All in all, kubefirst is your one-stop tool to create production-ready Kubernetes platforms in minutes instead of months, so that teams of any size can instantly leverage the value that Kubernetes provides by starting with the most popular tools and adjusting the platform from there.
