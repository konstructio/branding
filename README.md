kubefirst provides fully automated open source application delivery and infrastructure management GitOps platforms delivering the best cloud native tools working together in minutes.

Supporting Amazon Web Service (AWS), Google Cloud, Civo, DigitalOcean, and Vultr clouds, you have the choice to use GitHub or GitLab as your Git provider. Using the CLI or the simple UI, you will end up with a full-fledged production ready Kubernetes cluster with tools like Argo CD, HashiCorp Vault, Terraform, and Atlantis.

All applications are managed by Argo CD using a single GitOps Git repository that you get to host and extend in any direction. The Terraform and Atlantis setup produces an audit log of all system changes in the single GitOps Git repository that also manages all your Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and resources. kubefirst provides a user platform and Single Sign-On (SSO) OIDC provider powered by HashiCorp Vault which is integrated throughout all of the platform tools, and used as the exclusive source of truth for all secrets.

All in all, kubefirst is your one-stop tool to create production-ready Kubernetes platforms in minutes instead of months, so that teams of any size can instantly leverage the value that Kubernetes provides by starting with the most popular tools and adjusting the platform from there.

## Company History

In 2017, [John Dietz](https://github.com/kubefirst/speaking/blob/main/speakers/john.md) and [Jared Edwards](https://github.com/kubefirst/speaking/blob/main/speakers/jared.md) met while working together on a cloud engineering team at a real estate big data startup. They were tasked with building an infrastructure management platform and application delivery system built entirely on Kubernetes.

Building their first Kubernetes platform together took the better part of a year, and eventually John and Jared moved on to do the same thing for other companies looking to adopt cloud native. Despite their experience building infrastructure and deployment platforms, they were surprised to discover that it consistently took many months to build a great Kubernetes platform from scratch - even when you know what youâ€™re doing.

Frustrated by the time consuming process, John and Jared began working together during nights and weekends to create an open-source solution to automate the process of platform provisioning, and the kubefirst project was born. In 2022, kubefirst was [acquired by Kubeshop](https://kubefirst.io/blog/kubeshop-acquires-kubefirst-gitops-infrastructure-application-delivery-platform/).

## Logos

Our logo is a combination of the name of the company, which is also the name of our product, and our mascot, named K-Ray. K-Ray is a beautiful, and friendly manta ray voyaging in the cloud native space.

When it's possible, we prefer that you use the horizontal version of our logo.

- [Black text (horizontal)](logo/kubefirst-dark.svg)
- [White text (horizontal)](logo/kubefirst-light.svg)
- [Black text (vertical)](logo/kubefirst-dark-vertical.svg)
- [White text (vertical)](logo/kubefirst-light-vertical.svg)

Those are vector SVG files, but if you need another format, or an image of specific dimensions, [let us know](mailto:info@kubefirst.io): we will send you the requested format(s) or size(s).

## Repository Badges

If you want to show your support with a badge on your repository, as in "powered by kubefirst", you can use the following badges.

![Powered by kubefirst](logo/badge-dark.svg#gh-dark-mode-only)![Powered by kubefirst](logo/badge-light.svg#gh-light-mode-only)

- [Badge for dark background](logo/badge-dark.svg)
- [Black for light background](logo/badge-light.svg)

Here's a code snippet you can use to do so:

```markdown
![Powered by kubefirst](logo/badge-dark.svg#gh-dark-mode-only)![Powered by kubefirst](logo/badge-light.svg#gh-light-mode-only)
```

Here's one using HTML:

```html
<picture>
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="badge-dark.svg" alt="Kubefirst Logo">
    <img alt="" src="badge-light.svg">
</picture>
```

_You can add HTML inside your README Markdown file, useful if you want to center them as example._
